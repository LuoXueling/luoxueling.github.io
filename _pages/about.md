🎓 I am a Ph.D. student at Cornell University in August, 2025, working with [Prof. Nikolaos Bouklas](https://blogs.cornell.edu/bouklaslab/group/). Previously, I have received B.Eng. and M.Eng. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). 

🔫 Besides a fulfilling academic life, I relax by playing badminton🏸 or video games🎮, taking photographs using my Fujifilm📷, going to the gym🏋️, walking around the campus🚶, drinking a little🍺, and eating half of a watermelon🍉 (2kg maximum).

If you find my Chinese given name Xueling difficult to pronounce [[Google translation](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=%E9%9B%AA%E7%81%B5&op=translate)], you can pronounce Sterling which sounds similar. My Chinese given name, which means snow (雪⛄) and elf (灵🧚).

# Research Interest

My research interests currently lie in **machine learning for mechanics**, **adjoint state method**, **optimization**, **GPU computing**. I have rich experience in **fracture phase field methods**, **data-driven computational mechanics**, and **physics-informed machine learning**.

# Open-source projects

I am truly a *programming guy* and sometimes even debug until 4 a.m. On [my GitHub](https://github.com/LuoXueling), you can find various projects I did for research and coursework that demonstrate my programming skills in computational mechanics and machine learning. 

* Regarding computational mechanics, I have released GitHub repositories for 2D/3D linear-elastic/hyperelastic static/dynamic finite element methods using MATLAB [[GitHub link](https://github.com/LuoXueling/FiniteElementMethodAndQuasicontinuumFracture)] and C++ [[GitHub link](https://github.com/LuoXueling/FiniteElementMethodForBeamAndTrussStructures)], 2D kinematics and dynamics using C++ [[GitHub link](https://github.com/LuoXueling/ComputationalKinematicsDynamicsOfMechanicalSystems)], and 2D steady incompressible flow and Stokes flow using Python [[GitHub link](https://github.com/LuoXueling/ComputationalFluidMechanicsSimpleExamples)]. 

* Regarding machine learning, I have open-sourced a machine learning platform named TabularEnsemble [[GitHub link](https://github.com/LuoXueling/tabular_ensemble)].
