# Research interest

My research interests lie in **fracture phase field methods**, **machine learning**, and **data-driven computational mechanics**. My current research aims to incorporate data-driven methods into traditional mechanical analysis such as the finite element method and fatigue life prediction methods to alleviate empiricism.
