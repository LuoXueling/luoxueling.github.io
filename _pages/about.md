üéì I will be a Ph.D. student at Cornell University in August, 2025, working with Prof. Nikolaos Bouklas. Previously, I have received B.Eng. and M.Eng. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I have published an article on [CMAME](#pub-2022-data-driven) as the first author, the other one on [IJNME](#pub-2024-multiscale) as the third author, and a latest [manuscript](#pub-2024-piml) accepted by *Composites Science and Technology*. 

üî´ Besides a fulfilling academic life, I relax by playing badmintonüè∏ or video gamesüéÆ, taking photographs using my Fujifilmüì∑, going to the gymüèãÔ∏è, walking around the campusüö∂, drinking a littleüç∫, and eating half of a watermelonüçâ (2kg maximum).

If you find my Chinese given name Xueling difficult to pronounce [[Google translation](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=%E9%9B%AA%E7%81%B5&op=translate)], you can pronounce Sterling which sounds similar. My Chinese given name, which means snow (Èõ™‚õÑ) and elf (ÁÅµüßö), looks and sounds like a girl's name.

# Research Interest

My research interests lie in **fracture phase field methods**, **machine learning**, **data-driven computational mechanics**, or more **general computational solid mechanics topics**. My current research aims to incorporate data-driven methods into traditional mechanical analysis, such as the finite element method and fatigue life prediction methods, to complement each other.

I am truly a *programming guy* and sometimes even debug until 4 a.m. On [my GitHub](https://github.com/LuoXueling), you can find various projects I did for research and coursework that demonstrate my programming skills in computational mechanics and machine learning. Regarding computational mechanics, I have released GitHub repositories for 2D/3D linear-elastic/hyperelastic static/dynamic finite element methods using MATLAB [[GitHub link](https://github.com/LuoXueling/FiniteElementMethodAndQuasicontinuumFracture)] and C++ [[GitHub link](https://github.com/LuoXueling/FiniteElementMethodForBeamAndTrussStructures)], 2D kinematics and dynamics using C++ [[GitHub link](https://github.com/LuoXueling/ComputationalKinematicsDynamicsOfMechanicalSystems)], and 2D steady incompressible flow and Stokes flow using Python [[GitHub link](https://github.com/LuoXueling/ComputationalFluidMechanicsSimpleExamples)]. Regarding machine learning, I have open-sourced a machine learning platform named TabularEnsemble [[GitHub link](https://github.com/LuoXueling/tabular_ensemble)].
